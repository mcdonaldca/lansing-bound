Lansing Bound
=============

Website built for Lansing Bound as part of my work for Spartan Innovations

As a general disclaimer, because I work on many different projects for Spartan Innovations, part of my job is to ensure that I get something functional, but not complete. There is a lot more I would have done to add/improve this project but in the interest of time, the project is simplified.

The basic functionality involves sifting through various events/places in the Lansing/East Lansing area. Most of the work went into Javascript interactivity and hooking up & working with the Google Maps API.
